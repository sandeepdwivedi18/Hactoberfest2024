## Word Guessing Game
The Word Guessing Game (similar to Hangman) gives you a random word to guess. You will be prompted to guess one letter at a time, and the game will reveal the correct letters in the word. You have 6 attempts to guess the entire word.

## Features:
1.The computer selects a random word from a list.
2.The player guesses one letter at a time.
3.The game shows how many guesses remain.
4.If the word is guessed correctly, the player wins. If the player runs out of attempts, the word is revealed.


## How to Play:

1.Run the word_guessing_game.py script.
2.You will see the word as a series of underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _ _).
3.Guess one letter at a time by typing it in.
4.You have 6 attempts to guess the entire word.


##  Requirements
Python 3.x (no external libraries are required)


## Future Improvements


1.Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that adjust the number range or allowed attempts.
2.Add a scoreboard or track the highest score for multiple players.
3.Add more words to the word guessing game.
